The goal of `rcctvm` is to produce top notch statistical models in bio medical research.

## Installation
You can install the development version of `rcctvm` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
pak::pak("Poduval/rcctvm")
```

## Examples

### Basic functions 
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rcctvm)
add2vars(2, 3)
```

### Predictions with survival model

#### Single input 

```{r}
predict_risk(sex = "female", wbc = 2.1, treatment = "new")
predict_risk(sex = "male", wbc = 4.3, treatment = "standard")
```

#### Vector input 

```{r}
predict_risk(sex = c("female", "male"),  wbc = c(2.1, 4.3), 
             treatment = c("new", "standard"))
```

#### Data frame input
```{r}
testdata <- data.frame(
  sex = c("female", "male"), 
  wbc = c(2.1, 4.3),
  treatment = c("new", "standard"))

predict_risk(x = testdata)
```
