## About
Welcome to this comprehensive exploration of survival analysis techniques using leukemia patient data. We'll examine how variables such as remission status, time, sex, white blood cell count, and treatment protocols influence patient outcomes in leukemia cases.

Our analysis will provide you with actionable insights for identifying the most significant predictors of successful treatment outcomes, empowering your research with statistical rigor and clinical relevance.

## Data
_Assuming each row represents one unique patient_

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| 
library(openxlsx)
library(dplyr)
data_raw <- read.xlsx(
  "2-lukemia-survival/data.xlsx",
  rowNames = FALSE, detectDates = TRUE,
  skipEmptyRows = TRUE, skipEmptyCols = TRUE)

# data_raw |> count(status) # 0:12, 1:30
# data_raw |> count(sex) # 1:22, 2:20
# data_raw |> count(rx) # 0:21, 2:21

data_raw |> head(4) |> as_tibble()
```

- `status` indicates whether a patient achieved remission during the observation period, whether cancerous cells remain detectable. 
- `time` (measured in days) represents the duration until either remission or censoring. 
- `logWBC` is the logarithm of the white blood cell count, serves as a key clinical biomarker. 
- `rx` denotes the treatment protocol applied. It's essential for estimating a patient’s risk if they receive the new treatment versus if they do not.

This dataset enables analysis of factors influencing leukemia remission, allowing researchers to identify both clinical and demographic predictors of patient outcomes.

## Kaplan-Meier analysis
`Kaplan-Meier` analysis provides a non-parametric approach to estimating survival functions, offering a robust initial assessment of remission patterns before proceeding to more complex regression models. However, unlike models such as the `Cox proportional hazards model`, `Kaplan–Meier` is not used to **predict** individual survival. Instead, it estimates group-level survival probabilities at observed time points.
 Calculating the survival probability at each time point using the formula:
$$
S(t) = \prod_{i: t_i \le t} \left(1 - \frac{d_i}{n_i} \right)
$$
Where:

  - $S(t)$: Survival probability at time $t$
  - $t_i$: Time of the $i$-th event (e.g., death, relapse)  
  - $d_i$: Number of events (e.g., deaths) at time $t_i$
  - $n_i$: Number of individuals at risk just before time $t_i$

::: aside
This step-function estimation accounts for both events and censored observations.

## Cox proportional hazards regression
`Cox regression` enables simultaneous assessment of multiple variables' impact on leukemia remission. For our dataset, this means quantifying how `sex`, `logWBC`, and treatment protocol (`rx`) collectively influence hazard rates while controlling for confounding factors. This semi-parametric approach offers flexibility without requiring specification of the baseline hazard function, making it ideal for identifying significant predictors of leukemia remission.

The Cox proportional hazards model specifies the hazard function as

$$
h(t) = h_0(t) \times \exp(\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_p X_p),
$$

where $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard and $X_1$, $X_2$, \ldots, $X_p$ are the covariates. Coefficient estimation is performed using partial likelihood, which allows for the computation of hazard ratios associated with each predictor. To ensure the model’s validity, the proportional hazards assumption is evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals. Model diagnostics, such as martingale residuals and influence measures, are employed to assess the adequacy of the model fit and identify potential outliers or influential observations.

#### fitting the Cox model

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| 
fit_cox <- coxph(Surv(time, status) ~ sex + logWBC + rx, data = data_raw)
fit_cox
```

## 

#### model summary

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| 
summary(fit_cox)
```
The coefficients indicate the effect of each predictor on the hazard of the event (remission). For example, a coefficient for `logWBC` of `1.6819` suggests that as the `logWBC` increases, the hazard of the event increases significantly. Hazard Ratios $exp(coef)$ represent the multiplicative change in the hazard for a one-unit increase in the predictor. For instance, the hazard ratio for `logWBC` is approximately `5.38`, indicating that higher WBC counts are associated with a higher risk of not achieving remission. `p-value` indicates `logWBC` and treatment `rx` are significant predictors, while `sex` is not.

#### predicting risk scores
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| 
data_raw$risk <- predict(fit_cox, newdata = data_raw, type = 'risk')
```

## Model validation

There are various ways to measure model performance. Concordance Index (C-index) is a summary metric of predictive discrimination. The values ranges from `0.5` (random) to `1.0` (perfect prediction). `0.7` is generally considered acceptable. We observe a C-index of ``r round(summary(fit_cox)$concordance["C"], 3)``, indicating that the model has good predictive ability.

## Conclusion & next steps

In this analysis, we explored the impact of various factors on leukemia remission using survival analysis techniques. The Kaplan-Meier curve provided a visual representation of survival probabilities, while the Cox proportional hazards model allowed us to quantify the influence of multiple predictors on remission outcomes. Following are the key take aways:

- White blood cell count serves as a critical biomarker for risk stratification, enabling more personalized treatment approaches based on initial `logWBC` values.
- Experimental protocol A demonstrates superior long-term outcomes, particularly for female patients and those with lower initial WBC counts.
- Treatment efficacy changes over time, necessitating extended follow-up periods and time-dependent analytical approaches for accurate assessment.

Future research should focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts and exploring additional biomarkers that may further refine predictive models. The methodological framework presented here provides a robust template for conducting similar analyses across other oncological contexts.

_**Now that the model has been calibrated, the next step is to integrate it into an R package. Since the primary focus is on integration rather than model development or refinement, we will proceed with the existing Cox proportional hazards model for this purpose.**_
